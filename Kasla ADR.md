# ADR - Architectural decision record
## Kasla
First version of Kasla is doing great and while I'm having good time woking on it I have 2 main problms:
1. Pinkie overuse. 
It was not such a big problem with Sofle and Voyager. I didn't have this problem at all. Hence I think the problem comes from too aggressive pinkie column stagger. 
Next desing has to have less stagger. I think that what Sofle has should work good.
2. Thumb keys not placed well. 
The main reason why I'm trying to build keybaord with new layout is that I feel discomfort in my thumb while using Sofle keyboard. At the begining I thought that it was just thumb overuse because I used 6 thumb keys on my modified Sofle version. Then I switched to Home Row Mods and it is better however after longer session I can feel my thumbs. They don't hurt but become weak and unreliable. Hence I try new keyboard.

The first version of Kasla which is choc spaced keyboard based on my hand measurments done with ergopad. Looks like in theory it I should have keyboard that perfectly fits my hand but for some reason it does not. I'm trying to address problems 1 and 2 with two different designs:
### Solutions
1. Kasla Rotated
2. Kasla Rectangle - without thumb cluster rotation of the keys. 

- While it seems nice to have keyboard without the rotation in thumb cluster keys it seems that it may not make sense to build one since our hands are build this way and it may be better just to extend the thumb instead of moving whole hand.
- When typing on KaslaWW (WW - Wrongly Wired) it feels like the thumb cluster could be inline with normal keys. However I'm afraid that when I will move pinkie column a little bit higher then my whole palm will rotate causing thumbs to extend on a little bit different angle. 


## Decision
- I need to think which modification I will try first. 

## Other considerations
### Index column stagger
When I work KaslaWW it feels like index column could be a little bit lower because index finger in may hand is a little bit shorter than my ring finger. However there is problem with Thumb cluster buttons then. My thumb is reaching bottom row of the keyboard anyway and moving index finger higher may cause this problem to grow.

!!! Stay  on current index finger column stagger


## Next day thoughts. 
Working on Sofle seems to not tear my pinkie even though I have exactly the same keymap as on my Kasla keyboard. Maybe I should consider changing layout to more Sofle like stagger with choc switches and then Voyager like thumb cluster with smaller rotation angle of thumb keys.

I think for now I will go more conservative and try choc sofle with rotated thumb cluster as it seems to fit my hand best.
